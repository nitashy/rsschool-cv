## About me
*******
I'm 31 years old. Worked as web-designer something about five years, but coding it's what I was always trully interested. For some time I studied HTML and CSS by myself, but now understand - I need help with it. For exemple, JS is hard to me. I very want to learn and become a front-end developer in future. I have a strong motivation and many time for it. I can work as a team. I'm smart, but more importantly, resourceful - this code solution didn't work? OK, no problem - I'll find another way. Working in web design taught me the ability to listen and ask clarifying questions. And stress resistance (the phrase "play with fonts" don't scare me anymore). I'm not afraid to try new.
